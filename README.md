# Multi-server MCP AI Agent

Automates your meetings, emails & docs via prompts 

## Setup Steps

1. # Clone and enter the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp-server-demo.git
cd mcp-server-demo
```

2.  # Create virtual environment and activate it
```bash
  uv venv
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

3. # Install dependencies:
```bash
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

4. # Create a Google Cloud Project and obtain credentials:

   a. Create a Google Cloud Project:
      - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
      - Create a new project or select an existing one
      - Enable the Gmail API for your project

   b. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:
      - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
      - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
      - Choose either "Desktop app" or "Web application" as application type
      - Give it a name and click "Create"
      - For Web application, add `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback` to the authorized redirect URIs
      - Download the JSON file of your client's OAuth keys
      - Rename the key file to `gcp-oauth.keys.json`

5. # Run Authentication:

   You can authenticate in two ways:

   a. Global Authentication (Recommended):
   ```bash
   # First time: Place gcp-oauth.keys.json in your home directory's .gmail-mcp folder
   mkdir -p ~/.gmail-mcp
   mv gcp-oauth.keys.json ~/.gmail-mcp/

   # Run authentication from anywhere
   npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp auth
   ```

   b. Local Authentication:
   ```bash
   # Place gcp-oauth.keys.json in your current directory
   # The file will be automatically copied to global config
   npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp auth
   ```

   The authentication process will:
   - Look for `gcp-oauth.keys.json` in the current directory or `~/.gmail-mcp/`
   - If found in current directory, copy it to `~/.gmail-mcp/`
   - Open your default browser for Google authentication
   - Save credentials as `~/.gmail-mcp/credentials.json`

   > **Note**: 
   > - After successful authentication, credentials are stored globally in `~/.gmail-mcp/` and can be used from any directory
   > - Both Desktop app and Web application credentials are supported
   > - For Web application credentials, make sure to add `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback` to your authorized redirect URIs

6. # Run Token generator:
```bash
uv run tokengen.py
```
